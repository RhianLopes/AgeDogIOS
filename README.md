# 🐶 Dog Age

The age of the dog is an application to calculate the age of the dog in comparete to the human age, therefore, for this, the age of the dog is multiplied by seven and we have the age of the dog compared to the human age. The goal with this app is to learn the development of IOS.

This app was built with the [IOS 12 Development course](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-desenvolvimento-ios/), at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), by instructor [Jamilton Damasceno](https://www.udemy.com/user/jamiltondamasceno/). This is my first IOS app and my first contact with [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), I hope you like it 🙂
